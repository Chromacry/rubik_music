# Rubik Music
Rubik Music is an Online Music Streaming Application. It's my year 1 first semester project when I entered Temasek Polytechnic. I've build it where music and playlist data are all stored on the internet instead of locally.
This application was build in 1 week time as I do not have enough time to add any other advanced features.
